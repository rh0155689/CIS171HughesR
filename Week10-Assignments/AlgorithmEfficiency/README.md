Week10Assign: Exercise 22_14 Execution time for prime numbers

This program is supposed to take three algorithms for finding prime numbers and compare
their efficiency.

## Example Output

This image will display as your example output. Name the image README.JPG in your project folder.

## Analysis Steps

Write a program that obtains the execution time for finding all the prime numbers less than 8,000,000, 
10,000,000, 12,000,000, 14,000,000, 16,000,000, and 18,000,000 using the algorithms in Listings 22.5-22.7.
My analysis of the requirements for this program consisted of watching videos, reading the chapter, and networking
on Discord. I was stretched beyond my understanding on this program and tried to duplicate the desired output, but 
don't believe the output is accurate. :( 

### Design

1) I started by creating an array of long type to hold the execution times.
2) Then, I created a couple of print lines to format the desired table to hold the results.
3) For each listing (22.5 - 22.7), I used a for loop that takes the start time, calls the respective
method, records the execution time, and subtracts the start time from the execution time.
4) Then, I  created three methods, one for each listing, and used the logic provided in the book for each
to find the prime numbers using different values.

### Testing


## Notes
I was very confused by the information in Chapter 22. I read and re-read the chapter and struggled to 
understand the concepts of algorithm efficiency. For this assignment, I am certain that the output is not
what was expected. :(

Explain any issues or testing instructions.
