![Sample Output](README.JPG)

## Analysis Steps

The goal was to take an animation originally written using Java FX path transition to run an animation
and to modify it to use a thread to achieve the same animation.

### Design

For this program, I used the pre-existing code for the FlagRisingAnimation and placed the path transition
inside of the run method using a thread.
```
Give examples
```

For this program, I was not exactly sure how to test the output, so once I got the program to run using
a thread I assumed it successful. :)
